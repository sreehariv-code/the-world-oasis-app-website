## Built with

- [Next JS 14 with RSC Architecture (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)

## What I have learned

1. To implement authentication & authorization using Next Auth
2. Fully leverage the usage React server components to implement list-based sites (cabins)
3. Use App Router methodologies to implement routing and using revalidation for routes to reflect server mutations and caching
4. Implemented middleware to handle authorization based routes

## Challenges that I have discovered

- As an initiative, I have decided to learn typescript through making this project as well. I have built this using typescript as the base language. As a learning perspective this was quite an intersting face to integrate typescript to the project, but as an overall I think this moment is much more rewarding

## Features

- User-friendly booking process
- Responsive design
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Real-time updates and revalidation
- Server-side rendering for improved performance

## Future Improvements
